'''
Use UTC to work with timestamps, with time not related to any location.
UTC is Coordinated Universal Time and is a system that provides a universal way of coordinating
time across locations. Most common standard for the time. If you use any specific time zone, you 
should be aware that nations might change the time at any point, which could make any of your calculations invalid.

'''
To send datetime objects in formats such as JSON or others that do not support native datetimes,
a common way to serialize datetime is by encoding them in a string using the ISO 8601 standard. 
This can be done by using isoformat, which will output a string, and parsing them with the fromisoformat method.
'''

d1 = dt.datetime.now(dt.timezone.utc)
print("Datetime in ISO format:",d1.isoformat())

#Get current time. Example using both datetime and time
time_now = time.time() 

#Use the UTC time zone when getting time with datetime. 
#This is necessary because time.time returns Unix time, which uses an epoch that is in UTC.
datetime_now = dt.datetime.now(dt.timezone.utc)

#Calculate the epoch by subtracting datetime and a time delta
epoch = datetime_now - dt.timedelta(seconds=time_now)
print(epoch) #The result is the Unix epoch â€” January 1, 1970, the date from when Unix time is counted.
